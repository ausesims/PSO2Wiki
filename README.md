# PSO2Wiki
PSO2 Wiki for the US is a project for the production of a wiki site for the Phantasy Star Online 2 game

More information will be released as the project unfolds. Please be advised of the following....

# Website
The website will be constructed using ASP.NET, or Wikipedia Wiki software. This is currently being evualated and depends on the information received back from SEGA.

# Sega Information - Pending
Information is pending from Sega. A formal request has been sent to see if information, and materials are avaiable to publish the site with.

# Publishing & Production
I expect the site to go live sometime within two or three weeks after hearing Sega's response to our inquiry. Due to the nature of this project repository access will be limited, until a peer review process has been establish to make sure accurate information is published on the stie. The site will be designed for users to still have logon, and can make comments or suggestions, but unlike other wiki's the information on this one will be locked and only autorized project members will have access.

# See the Project Wiki on this repository for any additional information.

# See this readme.md for any update information avaiable.
